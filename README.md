PROJECT <br>

The aim of this research project is to investigate whether whole exome sequencing and variant prioritisation using the Exomiser platform could be used to increase the diagnostic yeild for 269 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients who were not found to have a known pathogeneic variant using current gene panel testing. <br><br>

GITHUB REPOSITORY <br>

This GitHub repository acts as a store and version control system for all scripts written and used within this project. For clarity, the project has been divided into directories representative of the workdflow. The 'run_exomiser' directory contains scripts that were required to run the exomiser tool for the 269 patient VCFs. Directories starting 'a#' represent the sequential analysis steps, which can be followed in the project write up. Supplementary README files are provided in each directory to provide further details of each analysis step. <br><br>
