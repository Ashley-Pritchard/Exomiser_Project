A7_SEGREGATION_STUDIES DIRCTORY<br>
The scripts in this directory align to the seventh section of the results in the project write up - segregation studies.<br><br>
<strong>familial_segregation.py:</strong> pulls data for variants that are seen in all members of a family and which have a combined exomiser score of more than 0.9. Takes input of run name and family ID and outputs passed variants as a csv.<br><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The histograms and box plots included as part of the write up of this results section reused the scripts that can be found in sections a1 and a2 respectively.
