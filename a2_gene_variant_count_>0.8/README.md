A2_GENE_VARIANT_COUNT_<0.8 DIRECTORY<br>
The scripts in this directory align to the second section of the results in the project write up - variant prioritisation on a combined score of >0.8<br><br>
<strong>variant_count_<0.8_pp.py:</strong> provides a count of the number of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive variants with a combined Exomiser score of more than 0.8 per patient and displays data as a boxplot. Prints the median to the terminal.<br><br>
<strong>gene_count_<0.9_pp.py:</strong> provides a count of the number of genes which harbour autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive variants with a combined Exomiser score of more than 0.8 and displays results as a boxplot. Meidan values printed to the terminal.
