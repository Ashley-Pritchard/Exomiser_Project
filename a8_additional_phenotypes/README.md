A8_ADDITIONAL+PHENOTYPES DIRECTORY<br>
The scripts in this directory align to the eigth section of the results in the project write up - additional phenotypes.<br><br>
<strong>pull_pheno_variants.py:</strong> pulls data for variants with a combined Exomiser score of more than 0.8 for patient cases which had addition phenotype data <br><br>
<strong>ttest.py:<strong> creates two bar plots of the average combined score and variant count of general analysis and those with additional phenotype information. Performs ttest calculation to assess whether differences are significant.<br><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> the histogram and boxplots included as part of the write up for this section were generated re-using the scripts in sections a1 and a2 respectively.
